# ESD-Lab-1

To-Do: 
1. Write a single assembly language program to execute Z=(X*8)/Y (Part-1)
2. Using WinCUPL, develop code for the Atmel AT16V8C SPLD and generate two outputs 
(Part-1)
a. /READ = /RD & /PSEN
b. /CSPERIPH =! (A15 & A14 & A13 & A12).
3. Design schematic for the above simulated operations. (Part-2)
4. Solder and wire wrap the components on a bare PCB board and verify the working by 
checking the output voltages with the help of Digital Multimeter and output waveforms 
with the help of Logic Analyzer and digital storage oscilloscope. (Part-3)
